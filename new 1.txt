Slave boots up
	1. Creates ephemeral node
	2. Contact master, give (IP, Path to ephemeral)
Master
	1. Assigns internal # to slave, stores mapping b/w # <=> IP
	2. Watches ephemeral
		a. if node goes down
			i. redirect clients to alternate
			ii. spawn a new slave with same internal #
			iii. stop redirecting 
			
		KR = { k1: 1's ip, k2:2's ip }
		Redirection = {1's IP: 1's IP, 2's IP:2's IP}
		now, if 2 goes down, 2's IP: 1's IP
	When client asks:
		a. Redirection[KR[]]
		
	in every slave- there'll be 2 dictionaries-1 which will be replicated to another server
	1 which will be replicated in this server
	Master Port- every slave will listen on this port for commands by master
	Client Port- which is for serving the clients
Master:
	Slave port
	Client Port

20 physical servers	... 4 servers came up of them..3 virtual servers...12 servers...
kr/12...5th one..15 kr/15..redistribute 

20 servers "virtual" 
1 : 20 
2 : 10, 10
3 : 7, 7, 6

fix key ranges- a b c and d are the only key ranges..a={0..10..values}
0:	
	1:a1,b1,c1,d1 
	2:X
	3:X
	4:X

1: 2 comes up
	1: [a1 c1] b2 d2
	2: [b1 d1] c2 a2

2: 3 comes up- a b c d
	1: [a1 d1] c2
	2: [b1] a2 d2
	3: [c1] b2

3: 4 comes up- a b c d
	1: [a1] d2
	2: [b1] a2 
	3: [c1] b2
	4: [d1] c2
Slave:
	Master Port: it'll listen for commands by master
	Client Port: it'll listen to client requests...Master will tell when it has to listen
Protocols:
Protocol for Syncing 2 servers
	-> replicating data..1->2


Protocol for slave registering with master
	-> think about key range distribution here-use fixed key ranges


Protocol for slave to start listening
	-> when the slave can serve requests to client- when the slave first comes up..
		30 sec-safeboot period; when keys are redistrbuted?
		if it is a read request: serve the request; else-return SafeBootException?
		GIVE EXCEPTION ANYWAY?hmm..read request we can serve know? yeah but it might
		not be responsible so why? it'll be responsible so only request will cme


Protocol on slave down
